// Asynchronous programming in JavaScript refers to a programming paradigm where tasks are executed independently of the main program flow. This means that instead of blocking the execution of subsequent code until a particular task is completed, asynchronous programming allows multiple tasks to be initiated and potentially completed out of order.

// In JavaScript, asynchronous programming is commonly achieved using mechanisms such as callbacks, Promises, and async/await syntax. These mechanisms enable code to continue executing while waiting for tasks such as network requests, file I/O, or other operations that may take an unpredictable amount of time to complete. By utilizing asynchronous programming, JavaScript applications can remain responsive and efficient, particularly in scenarios where tasks involve I/O operations or interactions with external resources.
